!Configuring Telnet using Manangement VLAN - VLAN99
vlan 99 - create vlan
name mgtVLAN - command to name the vlan

to transfer the port from vlan 1 to vlan 99
int g0/1 - specific port to transfer
switchport mode access - converting dynamic port to static port
switchport access vlan 99 - command to transfer the port

vlan 99 
name mgtVLAN
int g0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 99

Port Security Commands
Identify the port
make the port static
give port security command
identify # of computers to access the port
look for the mac address of the PC and bind it to the selected port
select violation if ever the conditions are not met
*protect
*restrict
*shutdown

int fa0/1
switchport mode access
switchport port-security
switchport port-security maximum 1
switchport port-security mac-address 000D.BD9B.C08D
switchport port-security violation shut

int range fa0/2-4
switchport mode access
switchport port-security
switchport port-security maximum 1
switchport port-security mac-address sticky
switchport port-security violation shut


Creating VLAN
1.  Plan out your design
VLAN virtual LAN
2.  Identify the ports to where you setup your VLAN
individual port
group ports
3.  Plan your VLAN ID
VLAN 10
4.  Plan your vLAN name
Name LB470, or name DCIS-Office
5.  Transfer each port to the created VLAN


connect same devices - cross over
different - straight thru

Remote Access Procedure

putting IP Add to an interface
int target interface
int vlan 1
ip address 192.168.10.2 255.255.255.0
no shutdown

192.168.10.1-9 <- reserve, router, switch, server, printer administrative
computer 
192.168.10.10


Tenetting
1. telnet should be activated in the initial configuration
    via line vty 0 4
2. assign an IP Address to a switch via SVI
    interface vlan 1
3. ping the IP Address first
4. telnet then the target ip address
    telnet 192.168.10.2



Structured Cabling

from PC -> wall mount Jack (rj 45-bracket)
           front -rj 45 connected to PC
           back - bracket connected to back of the patch panel
patch panel -> front - rj45 connected to switch
               back - bracket connected to RJ 45 jack
